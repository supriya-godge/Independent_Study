The processing of the Game server:

1) A server(Engine.java) is always running. It waits to recevie the request on the port 9001.
2) A user starts the Client proxy program. Client proxy instantiates the players.
3) Client proxy connects to the server on the port 9001.
As a response to the connection server sends this message to Player:
{"JSONCommand":"Confirm","Status":"Successful","GameId":1001}
5)Client proxy then initiates the game by sending the init message with the player information.
From Client proxy to server {"JSONCommand":"Initialize","Player2":999,"Player1":60}
where, 999 is a reserved id for the server player.
6) The engine then instantiates the server player and starts the game.
7) Engine starts the game, by requesting the move from both players. The game ends when,
    i) One player has won
    ii) Game is draw
    iii) Both players are invalidated
8) Engine directly communicates to the server proxy, engine doesn't care if the player is local or remote.
it is handled by the server proxy.
9) Server proxy then checks if the message is directed to the server player or the remote player.
If it is a remote player then server proxy uses the socket to send the message.
If it is a server player then server proxy uses the method call to send the message.
